# Excel-Blank-Cell-Filler-VBA

üöÄ Automating Data Management in Excel with VBA üõ†Ô∏è

Imagine you have an Excel worksheet with data organized in two adjacent columns, J and H. In this setup, column J has intermittent blank cells, while column H is fully populated with values. The goal is to programmatically fill the empty cells in column J with the corresponding values from the cells directly above them in the same column.

To achieve this task efficiently using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), you can follow these steps:

Determine the Last Row: Utilize VBA to find the last row of data in column H, ensuring accurate processing.

Iterate Through Each Row: Employ a loop to traverse each row in column J, starting from the second row.

Check for Blank Cells: Within the loop, assess if the cell in column J for the current row is blank.

Fill Blank Cells: If a blank cell is detected in column J, assign it the value of the corresponding cell directly above it in the same column.

Repeat Until Last Row: Continue this process until all rows have been examined, ensuring seamless filling of blank cells with adjacent values from column H.
